Valentinians and the Bible

Introduction

Like all Christians, Valentinians regarded the Bible as authoritative
scripture. They were the first Christians to write extensive commentaries
on the Gospels. Their unconventional interpretive methods were frequently
criticized by their contemparies. In Egypt, they were among the earliest
translators of Biblical texts into Coptic e.g. Papyrus Bodmer III (M.
Massaux, 1959, New Testament Studies 5, pp 210-12).

Old Testament

The Old Testament stories were interpreted allegorically. As with other
early Christians, the most commonly referenced book was Genesis. The Old
Testament Law was divided by Valentinians into:

1. true law fulfilled by Christ (e.g. Ten Commandments)
2. law meant symbolically
3. unjust law abolished by Christ
4. human legislation which is not binding

Old Testament books refered to in Valentinian sources include:

1. Genesis
2. Exodus
3. Numbers
4. Leviticus
5. Deuteronomy
6. Joshua
7. 1 Samuel
8. 1 Kings
9. Psalms
10. Song of Songs
11. Proverbs
12. Isaiah
13. Lamentations
14. Ezekiel
15. Daniel
16. Hosiah

New Testament

Valentinians claimed to offer a spiritual interpretation of the New
Testament. In general, ethical passages such as the Sermon on the Mount
were taken literally. Other passages and stories were interpreted
allegorically. As Elaine Pagels (1973) shows, individual passages could
have up to three layers of allegorical meaning.

Books referred to include:

1. Matthew
2. Mark
3. Luke
4. John
5. Romans
6. 1 Corinthians
7. 2 Corinthians
8. Galatians
9. Ephesians
10. Philippians
11. Colossians
12. 1 Timothy
13. Hebrews
14. James
15. 1 Peter
16. 1 John
17. Revelation

Noncanonical Works

Like all Christians of the time, Valentinians made some use of some works
which were not later incorporated into the official canon of scripture.
These include:

1. The Apocryphon of James This work describes the final conversation
Jesus has with James and Peter before he ascends to heaven. Scholars
are sharply divided as to whether this work is Valentinian or Jewish
Christian in origin.
2. The Gospel of Thomas A collection of sayings of Jesus possibly used by
Valentinus, Theodotus, Ptolemy and Herakleon.
3. Gospel of the Egyptians This work seems to have been a sayings gospel
similar to the Gospel of Thomas. It was used by Egyptian Christians
including Valentinians in the second and third century. Apart from a
few excepts, this work is now lost.
4. Proclamation of Peter This was a pseudonymous Christian apologetic
work which was widely circulated in the second century. It was used by
Herakleon in his Commentary on the Gospel of John. Much of this work
survives.
5. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas This is a collection of legends about the
childhood of Jesus. It was used by used by Marcus. The work was a
favorite of Catholics and survives virtually intact.
