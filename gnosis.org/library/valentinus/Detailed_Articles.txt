Detailed Essays on Valentinianism

Introduction

Valentinians taught a type of esoteric or "Gnostic" Christian theology. It
stood in much the same relationship to Catholic Christianity as the Kabala
does to mainstream Judaism. Valentinians made use of a series of elaborate
metaphors to describe how human beings have become alienated from God and
how they can be reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.

In these articles, many of the major themes are explored in detail,
drawing on all surviving sources. No attempt has been made to distinguish
the teaching of Valentinus from that of his school since only a few of his
own writings survive.

Important variations between different strands of the Valentinian
tradition are noted, but we will not dwell on them excessively. Many of
these differences such as those in the naming and ordering of Aeons and
details of the myth are largely cosmetic. The ideas underlying these texts
can be seen as a coherent body of thought.

These articles have been written over a fifteen year period. Many of them
have their origins as far back as the mid-1980's. These articles are not
meant to be a substitute for reading the original texts.
