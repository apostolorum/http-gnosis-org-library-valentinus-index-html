Valentinus and the Valentinian Tradition

Valentinus was one of the most influential Gnostic Christian teachers of
the second century A.D. He founded a movement which spread throughout
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Despite persecution by the
Catholic Church, the Valentinian school endured for over 600 years.
Valentinus' influence persists even today. This site is dedicated to the
Valentinian Gnostic tradition and features scriptures as well as articles
on the teachings of the school. (An excellent introduction to Valentinus
and his tradition is also given by Dr. Stephan Hoeller in  Valentinus: A
Gnostic for All Seasons, available in the Archives.)
